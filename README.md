# TurtleBot4 Navigation Workspace

This workspace contains the packages for running both simulation and real-world tests.

## Building the Workspace

Run the following command inside the `ros2_ws` folder (**must be located in your home directory**, otherwise the scripts won’t work):

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

> `--symlink-install` allows Python packages to be used without needing to rebuild after code edits.

---

## Running Simulation Tests

To run simulation tests, execute:

```bash
python3 repeat_test.py
```

This will automatically launch:

* `battery_logger`
* `cmd_vel_logger`
* `nav2_cpu_logger.py`
* `nav_metrics_logger`

There’s also a lightweight `min_nav_to_pose` script that only activates the initial pose and goal position, without logging any metrics.

---

## Logging Local Planner Behavior

To count how often the local planner makes changes, you’ll need to **manually update the subscriber topic** in `nav_to_pose.py`.

There are comments in the nav_to_pose.py file explaining which topic to use for each controller.

---

## Changing Navigation Controllers

To switch the navigation controller or planner, edit:

```bash
~/ros2_ws/src/turtlebot4-jazzy/turtlebot4_navigation/config/nav2.yaml
```

* The **RPP controller plugin** is placed under the `FollowPath` section.
* To use a different controller, replace the whole section under `FollowPath`.
* Good example configurations:

## Running Real-World Tests

Real-world tests require several processes to be started manually due to frequent crashes and general instability.

### 1. Start the Robot

First, plug the LiDAR camera back in and launch the robot's standard startup in the SSH'ed terminal. Without this, the robot won’t function:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_bringup standard.launch.py
```

### 2. (Optional) Enable Autostart on Boot

If you want the robot to launch automatically on boot, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable turtlebot4.service
```

Then reboot the robot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

However, it’s useful to keep the manual launch option available. When the robot crashes or shows errors, manually restarting the standard launch usually fixes it temporarily.

### 3. Navigation testing steps:

First repeat the colcon build steps from the simulation setup

Run these commands in this order to launch a navigation task:

#### On SSH'ed terminal (except step 3):

1. File already located on the turtlebot at VU

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_navigation localization.launch.py map:=/home/ubuntu/FullMap5.2.yaml
```

2.

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_navigation nav2.launch.py
```

3. *(Run locally, **not over SSH**)*:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_viz view_navigation.launch.py
```

4.

```bash
python3 nav2_cpu_logger.py
```

5.

```bash
ros2 run tb4_nav_to_pose realW_nav_to_pose
```
